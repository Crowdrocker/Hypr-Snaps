My Name is Matthew and my github is Crowdrocker WehttamSnaps on Twitch, and WehttamSnaps on youtube. I'm a full time wedding and photobooth photographer but I love gaming as well. I'd like to create a complete Arch Linux Hyprland  setup for streaming and work for WehttamSnaps. Coming from windows 11 BTW, also WehttamSnaps is my name spelled backwords. 

* Shell i found that i really like are: 

- noctalia-shell https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell.git A beautiful, minimal desktop shell for Wayland that actually gets out of your way. Built on Quickshell with a warm lavender aesthetic that you can easily customize to match your vibe. noctalia comes with just a shell itself. compatable with hyprland

One thing that stud out to me about noctalia is that you can easily add more widgets following his wiki as well as Create my own Matugen template, which i'd like help with.

I used to have a dell studio xps 9100, which worked amazingly. But just the other day I was doing some work. and suddenly kept randomly turning off. After it did it about 3 times, it did come back on with a solid amber light. So I looked up the manual and it said it's usually the power suply or cmos battery. I changed the battery and new power supply. I powered up but now Post and the fans just kept spinning, I did more searching and some people with the same problem said to change the ram. That also didnt work. I decided to give up on it because i'm on a budget and money was running low and getting new parts. But as i figured that I most likely needed a new motherboard.  I just built a budget pc from an old pc I bought from facebook marketplace. I used the parts that I had already had from my Dell. It Has an i5-4430, replaced gpu with RX580, has 16GB ram, replaced hdd hard drives with ssd. 1TB ssd for games and files, 120GB for Linux and another 120GB for windows. Also replaced the fans and applied new thermal paste as well as a new power supply 750w with a single monitor. The CPU was running hot before the new thermal paste and CPU temps dropped 15-25°C under load.but not sure how to control the fans. It only had the cpu fan and I added one more. It's a small case so it can't fit too much in it. I have another gpu as well that I have from my dell xps 9100 which is a GTX 1650. I know its not much of a pc but it works for me for the time being unitil I can get a better one. 


 
My question:
1) Which one would benefit me most: the gtx 1650 or rx 580?
2) Should i fork a preconfig and tweak from there or start from scratch? 
3) I tested them and listed things I liked about them, Not sure how to kinda mix and match. If that's even possible without breaking something.

* First option which was suggested to me on reddit is install Hyprland with Noctalia-https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell removing the waybar and adding personal custom stuff

* Second option which was install or fork JaKooLit or Omarchy and tweak with my own settings adding Noctalia-https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell removing the waybar

* Third option which was suggested to me on reddit is install Hyprland with Noctalia-https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell removing the waybar and and taking things i like from JaKooLit or Omarchy

- themeing things from JaKooLit
- workflow and functionaliy from Omarchy

I would like to help with a Quickshell setup. I'd like to may my own custom Quickshell bar if possible add some of my own widgets. something nice and clean also i'm not a fan the bar being to the left or right. but top or bottom is fine.
---


4) When all is done with everything, how do I go about saving my progress?
5) How can i make a quickshell widget template maker of if that is even a thing?
6) Is it possible to separate hyprland so its not one long config

I'd like if you can make a Component Integration Strategy, Component | Best Template | Modifications Needed. What to use as Base. Also how to incorporate work/gaming widgets in quickshell Noctalia and repo structure

All sounds i've made from https://www.101soundboards.com/ using 73296-jarvis-v1-paul-bettany-tts-computer-ai-voice and 1023595-idroid-tts-computer-ai-voice
If you have any Suggestions for some other ones i can add let me know :) Or a list of tts Sayings 
-jarvis-startup.mp3 - "Good morning, Matthew. All systems operational." -  `exec-once` section to play `jarvis-startup.mp3`. make it conditional (e.g., check `date +%H` for "Good morning/afternoon/evening, Matthew").
-lets try this one-->jarvis-startup.mp3 - "Allow me to introduce myself, I am JARVIS, a virtual artificial intelligence. All systems are ready for gaming and work.
-jarvis-shutdown.mp3 - "Shutting down. Have a good day, Matthew." - Create a script (`shutdown_jarvis.sh`) that plays `jarvis-shutdown.mp3` before initiating system shutdown, and bind it to a key combination or power menu entry.
-jarvis-notification.mp3 - "Matthew, you have a notification." - Configure `dunst` to play `jarvis-notification.mp3` for incoming alerts.
-jarvis-warning.mp3 - "Warning: System temperature critical." - Integrate `jarvis-warning.mp3` with system monitoring scripts (e.g., high CPU/GPU temp, low disk space).
-jarvis-gaming.mp3 - "Gaming mode activated. Systems at maximum performance." - Create scripts that play `jarvis-gaming.mp3` and `jarvis-streaming.mp3` when these modes are activated (e.g., via Quickshell widgets).
-jarvis-streaming.mp3 - "Streaming systems online. All feeds operational
*   **J.A.R.V.I.S. Boot Animation:** Custom SDDM login screen with J.A.R.V.I.S. animations or a pre-login script that displays an ASCII art J.A.R.V.I.S. logo and plays a sound.


###### Audio Routing like Voicemeter on Linux
----Use PipeWire with qpwgraph for advanced audio routing.
----Pavucontrol for simple volume management.
----Create virtual sinks and routes using qpwgraph to separate audio streams (game, browser, discord, Spotify).
----can provide a step-by-step guide for qpwgraph and pavucontrol setup.
-----Write scripts for J.A.R.V.I.S. sound triggers integrated with Hyprland events.

- Any help you can give me will be appreciated in helping  me and i'm up for any other ideas that i may have not mentioned. 
- I'd love it if you could send a full install script for easy uploading and or copy and paste codes
- Hyprland configs
